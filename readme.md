# Star Trek: DS9 Episodes worth watching

These are the episodes I think you should watch to get through the first few seasons of DS9. If you disagree, that's your prerogative, but be prepared to back up your argument and file a pull request to make the change yourself.

## Advocating for the inclusion or exclusion of an episode

So you think you can Star Trek better than me.

Create a PR and edit data/picks.json to reflect your changes. Each array in picks.json represents 1 season. The numbers represent selected episode numbers **the episode numbers are not zero-indexed**.

After making your changes, you'd better include a damn convincing argument for why your change is warranted. And your JSON better be valid.

## Adding episode notes

The template allows for the inclusion of a "notes" field in data/episodes.json. If you have any notes or tips to convey to viewers, just add a "notes" field to the episode in question and file a PR.

## Forking ideas

If you wanted to, for example, create a list of only the Ferengi episodes because that's your idea of fun, you could totally just fork this and modify picks.json to only display Ferengi episodes. That's a terrible idea though.
